MIAMI HEAT DATA ANALYSIS CHALLENGE

1. Which game do you think performed the best, and why?
The April 1st, 2023 game against the Dallas Mavericks was the best-performing,
generating a season-high $2.69M in revenue from 17,316 tickets sold—the highest
volume across all games. It also had the highest average ticket price ($155.51),
indicating strong demand with optimized pricing. While premium seats accounted
for just 1.7% of total revenue, the consistent premium mix across games suggests
this game’s success came from high volume and effective pricing strategy.
Additionally, over $1.96M came from Season Plan revenue, showcasing strong longterm engagement and a loyal fanbase—making it the most commercially successful
game of the season.




2. Which game do you think performed the worst, and why?
The December 8th, 2022 game against the Los Angeles Clippers was the worstperforming, bringing in the lowest revenue at $2.37M, despite a comparable ticket
count (16,830 sold) to other games. It had the lowest average ticket price
($141.09) and the lowest premium revenue share (1.4%), suggesting weaker
demand for high-value seating. Only 33 premium tickets were sold compared to
over 16,700 non-premium seats. While Season Plan revenue remained strong
($1.96M), the game's underperformance points to low per-ticket value and minimal
premium engagement, likely tied to a less compelling matchup or poor timing late in
the season.





3. Any other insights?
Across all games analyzed, ticket sales were consistently strong, with each event
drawing over 16,000 attendees. However, revenue performance varied more due to
pricing and premium engagement than volume alone. While the Dallas Mavericks
game had the highest revenue, this was driven by a combination of optimized average
pricing ($155.51) and the highest ticket count, not premium seating. In fact, premium
revenue made up less than 2% of total revenue across all games—suggesting that
premium inventory may be underutilized or undervalued in pricing and marketing
strategies.
Additionally, Season Plan sales were the dominant driver of revenue, accounting for
nearly 77% of total income across the four games, highlighting a strong and loyal
season-ticket base. This presents an opportunity to upsell premium upgrades to existing
plan holders.
Interestingly, weekday games like the 76ers and Bulls still performed well, implying
that game day (e.g., Wednesday vs Saturday) may not be as strong a predictor of success
as opponent quality and pricing strategy.
Lastly, despite high attendance, there is room to improve yield per ticket, especially in
non-premium seating, by exploring dynamic pricing models, more aggressive upselling
of premium seats, and targeted campaigns tied to high-demand matchups.
